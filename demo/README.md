## Description
- Understanding server-side APIs is an important part of any coding journey. Working with them on this project will go a long way in advancing my coding skills and knowledge.
- The changing weather and its patterns are an integral part of daily life for everyone. Knowing the current and future weather will help anyone make or change plans, depending on how the weather affects them. This webpage allows for one to check the current weather, as well as the weather for the next 5 days.
- Having a simple, convenient web page for checking local weather is valuable, as well as the fact that it is devoid of the plethora of ads you typically find on a classic search engine.
- This project helped me better solidy my JavaScript knowledge, especially when I switched to working predominantly in jQuery. I also learned a lot more about navigating server-side APIs, changing their parameters, and finding how to best manipulate them for my needs.
